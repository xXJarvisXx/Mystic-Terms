# Terms of Service

Last updated: 05 March 2022

Thank you for considering to use Taka ("Taka, "bot", "we", "our", "the service") in your Guild ("server", "guild"). In order to allow us to deliver all services, you are required to agree to these terms. If you choose not to agree, you must remove Taka from your guild.

## Outline

You are prohibited from using Taka to break Discord Terms of Service (https://discord.com/terms) or for any illegal purposes. While we do our best to make sure this doesn't happen, you are encouraged to contact us either at https://support.taka.moe or by via email apex@taka.moe if you suspect that something of this nature involving Taka may be happening. In addition, you are responsible for ensuring that members of your server are aware of these terms and agree to them.

## Legitimate use

You are prohibited from using Taka in a way that hinders the experience for other users. This includes but is not limited to exploting a flaw, intentionally degrading performance of the service, and more. Such cases will permanently disallow your usage of the service both in the offending guild and any other guild, as well as the possibilty for further action depending on the severity of the event.

## Guarantees and warranties

Taka is provided "as-is" and without warranty or promises that the service will be available in the future. While we do our best to ensure a high standard of reliability is being kept, no guarantees are made in this regard, nor are guarantees made that the service may not be repurposed at a later date. Most user data is non-transferrable and can be deleted without reservation. Access to the service can be revoked for a specific  user or guild at any time. Similarly, any "Plus" and "Premium" features are not guaranteed and can be revoked at any time. Refer to the Refund policy below.

## Refund policy

We may provide refunds for any Plus or Premium subscriptions under certain conditions
- A montly subscription was started less than 5 days before the next payment date. For example, a subscription was started on Feb 28 with the next payment due Mar 01.
- A significant Plus/Premium feature was removed, or a specific feature that the user subscribed for is no longer present.

If a user subscribed to Plus/Premium violates these Terms of Service, their subscription will be cancelled and a refund will not be given.
